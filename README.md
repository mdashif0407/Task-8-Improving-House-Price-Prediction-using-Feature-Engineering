# Task-8-Improving-House-Price-Prediction-using-Feature-Engineering
This project improves house price prediction using advanced feature engineering techniques on the Kaggle "House Prices – Advanced Regression" dataset.

Task performed :
Cleaned missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)

Performed log transformation on skewed target variable

Applied Label Encoding for ordinal features

Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal features

Trained a RandomForestRegressor

Evaluated model using RMSE

Extracted feature importance

Key Insights:

Proper feature engineering significantly improved model performance

Log transformation made the prediction distribution more stable

Most important features included:

OverallQual

GrLivArea

TotalBsmtSF

GarageCars

1stFlrSF

One-hot encoding helped the model understand categorical data
